# Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform facial recognition using computer vision techniques. The notebook uses the Yale Faces dataset and the OpenCV library to train a facial recognition model and classify test images.

# Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* zipfile
# How to use

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the necessary libraries.
3. Open the Facial Recognition using Computer Vision.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and classify test images.

# Functionalities

* Training: The notebook loads the Yale Faces dataset, preprocesses the images, and trains a facial recognition model using the LBPH algorithm.
* Classification: The notebook allows you to load a test image and classify it using the trained model.
* Preview: The notebook displays the test image with the predicted ID and the correct ID for comparison.

# Comments

* This notebook is a teaching example and can be adapted for different scenarios.
* The quality of facial recognition depends on the quality of the images and the size of the dataset used in training.
* The Yale Faces dataset is a relatively simple dataset, and other more challenging datasets can be used to train more robust models.

# Improvements

* Add support for other facial recognition algorithms.
* Implement more advanced image preprocessing techniques.
* Evaluate model performance on different datasets.
